# My BAP Project

This WordPress project was made for a real client and composed of 2 students in communication, 3 in creation & design, and 2 developers (including myself), directed by 2 project managers.

## What is it for?

This project was requested by the resource center of Torcy.

The goal was to have a website that allows users to see a list of products and be able to reserve them.
